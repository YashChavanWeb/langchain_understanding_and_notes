## Comparison between Open Source and Closed Source Models

| **Aspect**        | **Open Source Models**                                                    | **Closed Source Models**                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**          | Generally free or low-cost (though may require infrastructure investment) | Often requires licensing fees or subscriptions; can be costly |
| **Control**       | Full control over the model, code, and training process                   | Limited control; vendor decides model behavior and updates    |
| **Data Privacy**  | High – data stays on-premise or under user’s control                      | Lower – data often sent to third-party servers for processing |
| **Customization** | Highly customizable; source code and training data can be modified        | Limited customization; user can usually only tweak inputs     |
| **Deployment**    | Can be deployed locally or on any cloud infrastructure                    | Usually tied to the vendor’s cloud or specific platforms      |
